# Pokedex
## Michelle Yang

### Description
Users will be able to navigate through a set list of Pokemon. They will be able to search for a speicifc Pokemon by name or see a full list of all Pokemone in the database. Each Pokemon will have a few attributed shown when clicked on. Users will also have the option to sort the Pokemon by type in order to see what the weaknesses of each. 

#### Back End
Using MongoDB, I plan to make a Pokemon database that will function as a Pokedex. Each Pokemon will have the same set of attributes and be attached to a certain type that determines the Pokemon's weakness.

#### Front End
With the help of React, Express and Node, I plan to display a home page where users can search a Pokemon by name. I also plan to have a page with all the Pokemon from the database. When clicked, the page will navigate to another page with the clicked Pokemon and some of it's attributes. There will also be a separate page where Pokemon can be displayed by type and showcase their weaknesses.
