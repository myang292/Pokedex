# Pokedex
## Michelle Yang

### Description
Users will be able to navigate through a set list of Pokemon. They will be able to search for a speicifc Pokemon by name or generate a random Pokemon. Users will also be able to navigate to a page that displays a full list of all Pokemone in the database. Once a Pokemon is searched or clicked on, users will be naviaged to a page displaying the Pokemon and attributes. Users will also have the option to sort the Pokemon by type via a dropdown bar and be shown the weaknesses of each. Users will also get the change to add and update the weaknesses of any Pokemon type.

#### Back End
Using MongoDB, Express and NodeJS I plan to make a Pokemon database that will function as a Pokedex. Each Pokemon will have the same set of attributes and be attached to a certain type that determines the Pokemon's weakness.

#### Front End
With the help of React I plan to display a home page where users can search a Pokemon by name. I also plan to have a page with all the Pokemon from the database. When clicked, the page will navigate to another page with the clicked Pokemon and some of it's attributes. There will also be a separate page where Pokemon can be displayed by type and showcase their weaknesses.
